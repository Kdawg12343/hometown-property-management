# Hometown Property Management — Starter

Static site ready for Netlify.

## Pages
- `index.html` — Home
- `owners.html` — Owner intake (Netlify Forms)
- `tenants.html` — Listings + tenant portal links (replace with your DoorLoop URLs)
- `services.html`
- `about.html`
- `contact.html` — General contact form (Netlify Forms)

## How to use
1. Upload all files to your GitHub repo (root level).
2. In Netlify, connect this repo. No build command is needed (pure static).
3. Enable **Forms** in Netlify to receive submissions from `owner-intake` and `contact`.
4. Replace the placeholder `href="#"` values for the **Tenant Portal** and **DoorLoop listings** with your real links.

## Customize
- Colors and fonts: edit `assets/styles.css`.
- Logo: `assets/logo.svg` (square, works as favicon).
